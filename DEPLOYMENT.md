# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ What I've Prepared for Deployment:

### 📂 Files Added/Modified:
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration for serverless deployment
- `dataStore.js` - Persistent file storage system
- `server.js` - Updated to use persistent storage
- `.gitignore` - Added data/ and .vercel directories

### 🔄 Storage Upgrade:
- ❌ Before: In-memory storage (data lost on restart)
- ✅ After: File-based persistent storage (data survives restarts)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

### Option 1: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from project root
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Using Vercel Dashboard
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect settings and deploy

## 🎯 Post-Deployment:

### ✅ What Works:
- All submissions are saved persistently
- Voting system works perfectly
- CSV export includes all data
- Auto-restart doesn't lose data
- Real-time updates work across users

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- On Vercel, each serverless function runs independently
- File storage works but has limitations in serverless environment
- For high-traffic workshops, consider upgrading to Vercel KV or database

### 🔧 If You Need Database Storage:
Let me know if you want to upgrade to:
- Vercel KV (Redis) - $$ but more reliable
- Vercel Postgres - $$$ but most robust
- Current file storage - Free but has serverless limitations

Ready to deploy? Just run `vercel --prod` in your terminal!
